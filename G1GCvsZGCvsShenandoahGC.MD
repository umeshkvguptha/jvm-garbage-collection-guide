# G1GC vs ZGC vs Shenandoah GC: Expert-Level Deep Dive

## **Overview**
Garbage Collection (GC) in Java plays a crucial role in optimizing memory management, preventing memory leaks, and ensuring smooth application performance. The three most advanced garbage collectors (GCs) in Java are:
- **G1GC (Garbage-First Garbage Collector)**
- **ZGC (Z Garbage Collector)**
- **Shenandoah GC**

This guide provides a **deep technical analysis** of these collectors, covering their internal mechanisms, object movement, stop-the-world (STW) events, tuning parameters, and real-world use cases.

## **1. G1GC (Garbage-First Garbage Collector)**

### **1.1 How G1GC Works**
- **Region-Based Heap Organization**: The heap is divided into **fixed-size regions** instead of contiguous Young and Old generations.
- **Incremental Compaction**: Reduces fragmentation and avoids long full GCs.
- **Predictable Pause Time Goals**: The GC prioritizes regions with the most garbage first.
- **Concurrent Marking**: Runs alongside application threads to track live objects without stopping execution.
- **Region Evacuation**: Moves objects from one region to another to free up fragmented memory.

### **1.2 G1GC Heap Structure and Object Movement**
```
+---------------------------------------------------+
|                     Heap                         |
+---------------------------------------------------+
| Young Gen (Eden + Survivor) | Old Gen | Free Space |
| Humongous Objects Regions                           |
+---------------------------------------------------+
```
- **Eden Space**: Newly allocated objects.
- **Survivor Spaces**: Holds objects that survived multiple minor GCs.
- **Old Generation**: Stores long-lived objects.
- **Humongous Objects**: Large objects are allocated directly in dedicated regions.

### **1.3 G1GC Phases**
- **Young GC (Minor GC):**
    - Triggers when Eden fills up.
    - Moves live objects to Survivor spaces.
    - Unused objects are discarded.
- **Mixed GC (Major GC):**
    - Collects garbage from both Young and Old regions.
    - Reduces Old Generation fragmentation incrementally.
- **Full GC (Fallback Case):**
    - Happens when heap runs out of space.
    - Triggers a Stop-The-World (STW) event.

### **1.4 Does G1GC Cause Stop-The-World (STW) Events?**
- **Yes, but minimized.**
- STW events occur during:
    - **Final Marking Phase** (verifying liveness before sweeping).
    - **Evacuation** (moving live objects between regions).
    - **Full GC** (fallback, costly operation).

### **1.5 Tuning G1GC**
- `-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=<n>` → Sets target max pause time.
- `-XX:G1HeapRegionSize=<n>` → Defines region size.
- `-XX:+G1UseAdaptiveIHOP` → Enables adaptive heap occupancy.

### **1.6 When to Use G1GC?**
✅ Best for **balanced throughput and latency-sensitive workloads**.
✅ Suitable for **Java applications with 1GB - 32GB heap sizes**.

❌ **Not ideal for** ultra-low-latency workloads (<1ms pause times).

## **2. ZGC (Z Garbage Collector)**

### **2.1 How ZGC Works**
- **Colored Pointers & Load Barriers**: Tracks memory references to reduce STW events.
- **Concurrent Relocation**: Moves live objects concurrently without stopping application threads.
- **Supports Large Heap Sizes**: Scales up to **16TB** efficiently.
- **Fully Compacting GC**: Prevents fragmentation in real-time.

### **2.2 ZGC Heap Structure and Object Movement**
```
+------------------------------------------------+
|                     Heap                       |
+------------------------------------------------+
| Marking | Relocation | Free Regions             |
+------------------------------------------------+
```
- **Marking Phase**: Identifies reachable objects concurrently.
- **Relocation Phase**: Moves objects **without** stopping execution.
- **Free Regions**: Cleared memory space available for new allocations.

### **2.3 Does ZGC Cause STW Events?**
✅ **Near-zero STW events** (only initial root scanning).
❌ **No full STW during normal operations.**

### **2.4 Tuning ZGC**
- `-XX:+UseZGC` → Enables ZGC.
- `-XX:+ExplicitGCInvokesConcurrent` → Ensures `System.gc()` runs concurrently.
- `-XX:ZUncommitDelay=<time>` → Controls memory uncommit delay.

### **2.5 When to Use ZGC?**
✅ **Best for ultra-low-latency workloads** (finance, AI, real-time analytics).
✅ **Ideal for applications requiring large heap sizes** (>32GB).

❌ **Not suited for** small heaps (<4GB).

## **3. Shenandoah GC**

### **3.1 How Shenandoah GC Works**
- **Concurrent Heap Compaction**: Avoids fragmentation while application runs.
- **Parallelized Algorithm**: Optimized for multi-core scalability.
- **Pause Time Independent of Heap Size**: Minimal stop-the-world impact.

### **3.2 Shenandoah Heap Structure and Object Movement**
```
+------------------------------------------------+
|                     Heap                       |
+------------------------------------------------+
| Young | Old | Free | Compacting Zone           |
+------------------------------------------------+
```
- **Young & Old Generations**: Stores short-lived and long-lived objects.
- **Compacting Zone**: Moves objects to prevent fragmentation.

### **3.3 Does Shenandoah Cause STW Events?**
✅ **Minimal STW (root scanning only).**
❌ **No full STW pauses.**

### **3.4 Tuning Shenandoah GC**
- `-XX:+UseShenandoahGC` → Enables Shenandoah.
- `-XX:+ShenandoahUncommit` → Releases unused heap memory back to OS.

### **3.5 When to Use Shenandoah?**
✅ Best for **low-latency, real-time applications** (gaming, interactive apps).
✅ Suitable for **moderate heap sizes (4GB-16GB).**

❌ **Not as optimized for very large heaps (ZGC is better here).**
